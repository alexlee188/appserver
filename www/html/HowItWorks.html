    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">How it Works</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>SGnurse is a platform where
      Singapore based nurses who are capable and interested in providing part
      time and short term home nursing services are linked via a mobile phone
      app.</p>
    <p>A potential customer or his/her family member can request for home
      nursing services by submitting details such as name, address, contact
      numbers etc., as well as what services, for how many hours, and when they
      need the visit.&nbsp; These details can be submitted on this website or by
      simply calling SGnurse admin at 97851440.</p>
    <p>The customer request, once confirmed, will then appear in the mobile
      phone app of the registered Singapore based nurses.&nbsp; Initially only
      certain information, such as the date/time of visit, the nursing services
      required, and the broad postal district of the customer, will be shown in
      the app.</p>

    <p>When a registered nurse is able to and interested in providing the
      service, he/she will request through the mobile app.</p>

    </p>
    <p>SGnurse admin will then do a match between the customer requirements and
      the qualification/experience/customer feedback of the nurse(s) to
      recommend a particular nurse.&nbsp; Only then will the full details such
      as the name, telephone number and address of the customer be disclosed to
      the selected nurse, who will then pay the visit at the appointment
      date/time to provide the services.</p>
